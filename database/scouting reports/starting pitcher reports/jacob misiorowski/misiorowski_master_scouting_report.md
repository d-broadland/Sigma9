## Real-World Scouting Insight

- **Debut (vs STL, June 2025)**: Electrifying but erratic; lacked consistent feel for secondaries. Raw tools on display with overpowering fastball and occasional wipeout slider.
- **Second Start (vs MIN)**: Historic. Set MLB record for most hitless innings to start a career. Showed newfound **slider command**, trusted it in all counts, and tunneled effectively off a sharp, arm-side changeup.

### Minor League Trend Highlights:
- Slider whiff rate: 40–45% at AA/AAA
- Circle changeup showed reverse splits effectiveness (success vs LHH)
- High strikeout rates (K/9 above 12.0 at all levels)
- Spotty BB/9 (4.5–5.0) but trending down post promotion

## Misiorowski Identity Summary

A long-levered flamethrower with A-tier vertical extension and elite arm speed. His fastball lacks movement but tunnels well with his slider/changeup pairing. While command still lags behind, Misiorowski demonstrated significant in-game adaptation by game two, suggesting he can execute advanced sequencing when dialed in.

## vs RHH Sequencing Guide (1B)

**0-0:** Slider, low-away or paint edge  
**0-1:** 4-Seam, high and in (elevated)  
**0-2:** Curveball or Slider, expand glove-side  
**1-2 (if needed):** Circle Change, arm-side fade below zone

---

## vs LHH Sequencing Guide (1B)

**0-0:** Circle Change, arm-side low (show it early)  
**0-1:** Slider, backdoor or low-in  
**0-2:** 4-Seam, top-middle  
**1-2 (if needed):** Curveball or Change, fade beneath zone

---

## Count-Based Modular Plan

### RHH:

- **1-0:** Slider away or low
- **1-1:** 4-Seam high
- **2-1:** Circle Change to induce chase or weak contact
- **2-2:** Slider or Curveball to zone edge
- **3-2:** 4-Seam if confident, Slider if hitter is sitting fastball

### LHH:

- **1-0:** Curveball early to steal strike
- **1-1:** 4-Seam up or Circle Change away
- **2-1:** Slider inside or backdoor
- **2-2:** Circle Change under zone
- **3-2:** Fastball top edge or Changeup for soft contact

## Notes for Sequence Engine Development

- Use **pitch attributes and real-world success rates** to dynamically prioritize Slider and Circle Change in 2-strike counts
- Build an **“elevate vs expand” toggler** depending on hitter profile
- If command stat improves midseason, rebalance confidence index toward expanded use of Curve and Change in early counts
